To Do's
=======
(in no particular order)

* create a features that add parent-child relationships to projects and cases
* debug socialcalc library install (done)
* (probably) create a feature for sheetnode configs (done)
* work on kt_bookmarks to:
        * create a block (or box?) that includes a link that's aware of groups (done)
        * ideally put the bookmark popup in a modal dialog
        * create a .tpl.php that better formats the bookmark popup (done, but doesn't work in Open Atrium)
* simpletests
