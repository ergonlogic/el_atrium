To Do's
=======
(in no particular order)

* create a features that add parent-child relationships to projects and cases
* debug socialcalc library install
* (probably) create a feqture for sheetnode configs
* work on kt_bookmarks to:
        * create a block (or box?) that includes a link that's aware of groups
        * ideally put the bookmark popup in a modal dialog
        * create a .tpl.php (I suppose) that better formats the bookmark popup
* simpletests
* coder cleanup patches (I'm such a nitpicker :p )
